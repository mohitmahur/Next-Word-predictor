**Next Word AI Predictor**


This is a Python application for predicting the next word in a sequence of text using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.

**Overview**


The Next Word AI Predictor utilizes LSTM neural networks to learn patterns in sequences of text data and predict the most likely next word given a sequence of input words. It is trained on a corpus of text data and can be used to generate text or assist in various natural language processing tasks.

**Features**

Predict the next word in a sequence of text input.
Train the predictor on custom text data or pre-trained models.
Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for building and training LSTM models.
Preprocessing text data using NLTK tokenizer.
Support for saving and loading trained models using pickle.

**Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required dependencies:


**Usage**
Train the Model
To train the AI predictor model on custom text data, run:


Load Pre-Trained Model
You can also load a pre-trained model using the provided script:

Predict Next Word
Once the model is trained or loaded, you can predict the next word in a sequence using the following command:
